# Threat Modeling
 
Threat Modeling assignment for the class Human Factors in Cybersecurity. 

Used STRIDE methods to analyze and illustrate specific vulnerabilities for in-person election polling sites that use paper ballots around the United States. Given the different voter requirements in specific states, we choose a state to represent each level of id/verification to vote.
